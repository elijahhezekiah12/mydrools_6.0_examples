My Drools Examples Repository

This is a repository which contains *my*  (heavily) commented (at the code level) Drools V6.0 (Selected) Example projects.

I chose those projects which were most educational to me (and hopefully you), and ported them over to a more
generic Drools project. However since they are Drools V6, they are, at their heart, Maven projects. Given that, I've
taken steps to ensure that this code works as is. Look for a Zip file that contains the entire project including my
notes on how to build the project (if you are inclined) and avoid the snafu's.

The philosophy of this little adventure is educational, to help the newbie make that leap from executing their first
helloworld example to comprenending the more advanced Drools concepts. I find that with a bit of a push, the beginner
can get their Drools 'sea legs' more quickly than on their own.

Note:
 * The official DOC for all the Drools V6 example is here: 
 * http://docs.jboss.org/drools/release/6.0.1.Final/drools-docs/html/ch19.html#d0e20175


For posterity sake, you can download the official (undocumented at the code level) Drools V6 Examples
here: http://download.jboss.org/drools/release/6.0.1.Final/drools-distribution-6.0.1.Final.zip

I also believe that this link is helpful as well:
